<h2> Description: </h2>
<p>
The application is intended to help users find inspiration and ideas for their projects and interests, and to connect with other users who share the same or similar interests. The application allows users to discover, store and share images related to their interests and hobbies. Users can create virtual pins of various topics, such as fashion, home decor, travel, DIY and more, by pinning images from the web or uploading their own. In addition, they can organize them into special collections and share them with others. They can exchange opinions on other users' posts by leaving comments, sharing various ideas, inspiration and getting feedback.
